Result summary. We implemented a pose-to-pose controller in limo_control (subscribes /odom, publishes /cmd_vel) and validated it in the provided limo_simulation. For the goal (x = 2.0, y = 1.0, θ = 1.57), we logged /odom and generated errors.png (distance and orientation error vs. time, with the 0.05 m and 0.1 rad spec lines). The controller met the requirement quickly: the first time both thresholds were satisfied was at 0.19 s. The final errors were 0.0453 m (4.53 cm) distance and 0.0897 rad orientation—both within the required ≤ 0.05 m and ≤ 0.1 rad bounds (AS SEEN IN THE END OF THE VIDEO). The motion uses a staged policy (rotate-to-goal → drive straight → final rotate) and is reproducible with the commands in the “How to Run” section.
