Result summary. We implemented a pose-to-pose controller in limo_control (subscribes to /odom, publishes to /cmd_vel) and validated it in the provided limo_simulation. During a run to the goal (x=2.0, y=1.0, θ=1.57) we logged /odom and generated the plot errors.png (distance and orientation error vs. time, with the 0.05 m and 0.1 rad spec lines). The controller reached the specification quickly and remained within bounds: the first time both thresholds were satisfied was at 0.31 s, and the final errors were 0.0468 m (4.7 cm) and 0.0848 rad, respectively. This confirms the controller meets the minimum requirement. The motion follows a staged policy (rotate-to-goal, drive straight, final rotate) and can be reproduced with the commands in the “How to Run” section.
